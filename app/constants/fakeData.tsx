      description: "Quite a bit of an uphill, great work out, me and the wife generally do about 6 miles. I have some very cool rides in this area, If you are more of an extreme MTB'r and you have a friend, I would suggest leaving a car at the Base of the boy scout camp on dobbins and 20th st. Huge entrance cant miss it park a car here, continue up in your buddies car down dobbins W to Central Ave, take a left and head up to the top of lookout mountain, when you get to the top park and get the bikes ready. take the road down to where the road splits, take a left to the national trail, when you get to the national trail take a right, this will take you down to the Geronimo trail and bring you back out  by the Boy scout camp, its pretty much mostly downhill and just a blast. Warning this is a very dangerous trail and you will be easily over the bars at any given moment, you must have experience to do this ride... AT your own risk.. its really pretty difficult.",
      directions: '7th Street & Mineral for Parking- no fees. There is a cross gate when the road dead ends this is where the trail begins, there is an up and down (trail forks app) then you will have a short jaunt in the parking lot, pass a trail head for hiking on your left and the the trail will be visible on your left Follow up and around into box canyon, there are many ways you can take, but all trails will eventually lead back home.',

This is a ride I do in the middle of summer, mid day. It usually isn't too bad, unless it's really humid, which is rare. Even then we rode for over an hour. It's not for the beginners because of some of the climb, and it gets you winded if you're going fast enough.",

Go on Galvin until McDowell. Take a right. Go until the corner of a Jaguar/Porche dealer and take it right onto College. (Dealership on right). Take that just over a mile. You'll see a stone sign for Canal Park. Take that. It's called Marigold. Park in the lot. Ride in the direction you were driving until you see trails on left. You could also go to the right and head for the big slick looking rocks. Those trails are much more tame, but still fun.",

      description: "Ridge Trail is one of the Hawes System's staple trails because it seems to have something for everyone.  From rocky, open face descents to steep single track climbs, this trail should not be taken lightly.  Many people would suggest that before you try to tackle ridge, you should definitely have a few rides under your belt.<br />\r\n" +
        '\tThis trail begins with a slight downhill that is extremely rocky.  You should take this part of the trail slowly if this is your first time as the right line to pick is sometimes hard to see.  A mistake on this section could send you toppling off the side of the hill.  If you are a seasoned rider however, this part of the trail can be done quickly as riding rocky sections faster can make up for poor line choice.  Once the red rock is cleared you begin the ascent to the peak of Ridge Trail.  This climb will hopefully cool down your body and relieve some of your tension from the section before it.  At the summit the views of Tonto National Forest and Fountain hills are absolutely stunning.  The trail then begins to slope down through tight single track.  This part of the trail is less technical and caters to riders with a little less experience but, it can be made as difficult as you like.  Not using your brakes through the turns and rock drops can even make a veteran rider cringe.  The end of the downhill will be marked by a rutted out descent into a wash (be careful here after a long rain. The wash can turn into a river if there is water runoff this can make it hazardous to cross). On the other side of the wash lies the physically difficult part of the trail with some steep climbs back out to power road.  Be prepared to gear down and stay in the saddle to keep traction on your back tire as this can be extremely slippery at times.  <br />\r\n' +
        '\tThis trail is a favorite among the people who I frequently ride with.  For improving your technical skill or your climbing ability Ridge is a great trail to practice on.  Once you have mastered this try moving on the trails like Mine (also in the Hawes System) and Pass Mountain (Usery Mountain Park).  If you are looking for adventure and an epic mountain biking experience, the Hawes Trails, particularly Ridge Trail, may be your answer.  Remember to always bring a buddy, a spare tube, and a great attitude.   ',

      description: 'There are many places to start this loop from really as it crosses other trails and the main road twice. The 15 mile loop can be cut in half or about more by either the Tonto Tank tr or the Bluff tr (very fun) that bisects the main loop. Most of this trail is pretty wide open desert riding, fun and fast it has a bit of a roller coaster feel to its flow. From the Pemberton there are several trails that lead out like spokes from a hub, the Scenic Loop tr is a 3 mile loop that is popular with the equestrian group. The Rock Knob tr, the Coach Whip trail is access to the Windmill tr that goes up and over the mountains to the Gateway Trail system. The Dixie Mine tr leads to the site of an abandon mine and also joins trails that lead to the Bell Pass (Lost Dog area) and also into the community of Fountain Hills.<br />\r\n' +
        'These trails are all well signed however it is advisable to pick up a free map at the Visitors Center for all the side trails but the Pemberton Loop itself is easily done without a map. <br />\r\n' +
        "If you happen to run across horse crap on the trails we cant really blame the equestrian folks as there are about a dozen wild horses roaming the park here too. They are friendly and sometimes approachable but I don't think we are going to potty train them any time soon.<br />",

        "From the parking area I head northeast and follow the powerlines along a jeep trail for a mile or so. It's a good warm up before you hit the singletrack. You'll see singletrack trails branching off of this jeep trail on the right that head out to several rock outcroppings in the distance. As you head toward these you will cross other trails. It's hard to get lost because you can always follow the powerlines or look at the many landmarks. Some trails are numbered.\r\n" +
        "It's a great ride because as you ride north you are gradually gaining elevation on a trail that has a lot of short ups and downs through boulders. It takes some skill to be able to get good speed going down to clear the uphill part. Lots of shifting and braking. The ride back is downhill and like a rollercoaster! Let it rip!",
